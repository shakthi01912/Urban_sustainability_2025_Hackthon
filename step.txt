ðŸ“Œ Step 1: Defining Research Questions & Key Variables

## Main Research Question
How do building features affect energy efficiency across boroughs in London?

## Sub-questions:
1. How does the **age of housing stock** impact energy efficiency?  
2. How do **building materials** and **construction styles** influence energy efficiency?  
3. Are there significant disparities in energy efficiency ratings across boroughs?  
4. How do energy efficiency disparities relate to **fuel poverty**?  
5. What boroughs have **implemented policies** to improve energy efficiency?  
6. How can **green building innovations** improve energy efficiency?

## Key Variables Selected:
| **Feature** | **Relevance** |
|------------|--------------|
| `UPRN` | Unique identifier for properties |
| `EASTING`, `NORTHING`, `LATITUDE`, `LONGITUDE` | Location details for spatial analysis |
| `WARD`, `ADMINISTRATIVE_AREA` | Borough-level grouping |
| `ESTIMATED_FLOOR_COUNT` | Indicator of building structure |
| `ESTIMATE_TOTAL_FLOOR_AREA_ALL` | Building size and potential insulation requirements |
| `SCU_FOOTPRINT` | Building footprint (impacts energy consumption) |
| `MEAN_OBJECT_HEIGHT_M` | Can relate to insulation efficiency |
| `MIX_CLASS` | Type of building (domestic vs. non-domestic) |
| `EPC_RATING_COUNT_DOM`, `EPC_RATING_COUNT_NONDOM` | Number of EPC certificates (energy efficiency measure) |
| `AGG_EPC_CURRENT_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_BY_COUNT` | Average energy efficiency per building |
| `AGG_EPC_CURRENT_ENERGY_RATING_BY_COUNT` | Energy rating (A-G scale) |
| `AGG_EPC_POTENTIAL_ENERGY_EFFICIENCY_BY_COUNT` | Predicted efficiency if improved |




ðŸ“Œ Next: Step 2 - Data Exploration & Summary Statistics


Summarize key statistics (mean, median, min, max) for numerical variables.
Visualize the distribution of energy efficiency ratings across boroughs.
Check for missing values and outliers.
